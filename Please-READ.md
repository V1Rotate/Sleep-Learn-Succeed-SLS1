--- General Idea ---
I was thinking about another interesting idea for a project to work on, something new and unique...

I reminded a scene from an old movie where a hero had to learn some material from the book overnight, but he was so 
tired and was falling asleep while reading a book. He would go for rest till the morning, but his relative was so 
strict with him and pushed him to read the book anyway. And that person was so smart - he ask his relative to help 
him and read the book for him while he is sleeping. He was joking, but sounded so serious that he know a theory saying that
it is possible to learn an information to be told while you are sleeping. So its like your brain is recording eveyrthing it heards 
while you are sleeping. That person failed next morning and was not able to tell the story from that book, however, all this story
gave me an idea for a new project to develop.

--- Website ---
That movie scene gave me the idea to imagine a technology that could help to learn while you are sleeping. I called it 
"Sleep.Learn.Succeed" or "SLS-1" (where "1" is the first device model, more to be developed). The website was developed for a 
potential customer, who is interested in this solution and would like to place a pre-order for the device which is going to be 
released for mass sales soon. The imagined manufacturing and developing company (SLS Technology Inc.) is based in Winnipeg. 

The website offers potential customers to learn more about the product and technology. The company has partnerships with Universities* 
in North America and promotes the "SLS-1" devices and the technology through the Education industry with more and the most interested 
potential customers- students and people who are actively learning and willing to learn and succeed faster.

--- IS THAT TRUE? ----
*The website idea and the information are the results of my imagination and are not true.
