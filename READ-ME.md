--- General Idea ---

I remember a scene from an old movie where a hero had to learn some material from the book overnight, but he was so tired and was falling asleep while 
reading a book. He would go for rest till the morning, but his relative was so strict with him and pushed him to read the book anyway. And that person 
was so smart - he ask his relative to help him and read the book to him while he is sleeping. He was joking but sounded so seriously that he know a 
theory saying that
it is possible to learn information to be told while you are sleeping. So it's like your brain is recording everything it heads while you are sleeping. 
That person failed the next morning and was not able to tell the story from that book, however, this story gave me an idea for a new project to develop.

--- Website ---

That movie scene gave me the idea to imagine a technology that could help to learn while you are sleeping. I called it "Sleep.Learn.Succeed" or "SLS-1" 
(where "1" is the first device model, more to be developed). The website was developed for a potential customer, who is interested in this solution and 
would like to place a pre-order for the device which is going to be released for mass sales soon. The imagined manufacturing and developing company (SLS 
Technology Inc.) is based in Winnipeg. 
The website offers potential customers to learn more about the product and technology. The company has partnerships with Universities* in North America 
and promotes the "SLS-1" devices and the technology through the Education industry with more and the most interested potential customers- students and 
people who are actively learning and willing to learn and succeed faster.

--- IS THAT TRUE? ----

*The website idea and the information are the results of my imagination and are not true.
